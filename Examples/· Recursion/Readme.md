* Recursion
  - Primitive Recursion
  - General Recursion
  - Tail Recursion (and Accumulation)

Note: Just because a function is listed under 'General Recursion' doesn't make it 
'not primitive recursive'. Although it might exist a primitive recursive definition 
of it. And don't forget, there are functions that aren't primitive recursive at all. 
The functions collected in here are written in a form that states, what recursion 
class it belongs to.
