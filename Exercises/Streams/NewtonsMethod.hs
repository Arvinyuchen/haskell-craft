-- Newtons Method.
module NewtonsMethod where




f :: Double -> Double
f x =  x


-- f(-1) = -1
-- f( 1) =  1




-- Given a function (f(x) for example), two x-values x_1 and x_2 and the contract that
-- for any two natural numbers supplied, the x-axis is intercepted exactly one time in [x_1 , x_2].
--
-- Define a function that uses Newtons Method to approximate the interception of the x-axis of the
-- given function in a stream. Ensure that each consecutive y-element in your list is either equal
-- or closer to the x-interception.



-- Possible solution:


newton :: (Double -> Double) -> Double -> Double -> [Double]
newton

 =  undefined
